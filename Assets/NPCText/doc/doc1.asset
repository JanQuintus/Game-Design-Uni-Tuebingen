  text1: Hello, the officer over there told me I could ask you about what exactly
    happened here?
  text2: 'Yes, I suppose he did. Hello by the way, my name is Doctor Lapsberg.

    So
    I doubt you have heard of it, since it happened 200 years back, but a meteorite
    hit our station

    and damaged one of our reactors. We managed to get it up
    and running without any problems, at least that''s what

    we thought at that
    time, because apparently there must have been some oversight. Soon after the
    incident

    some of our people were reportedly showing smaller mutations,
    not many generations after we had newborn kids looking

    so horrible that
    we had no choice but to isolate them and keep them in continuous care under tight
    security.'
  text3: "What happened then is hard to explain, our science staff said that some
    of the mutating properties of our new\r\npower element, which we found together
    with Graviterial on that weird planet seems to work exponentially, \r\nmeaning
    that the amount of mutations per generation ramps up quickly.\r\nThe number of
    people showing mutations also grew over time, and six months ago we suffered
    a safety breach.\r\nWe had to deploy countless measures of containment, most
    of which have been unsuccessful."
  text4: Uhh okay that was a lot... thank you. Does that mean that it is still dangerous
    to go out?
  text5: 'Apart from the mutants there''s still radiation out there, however judging
    from the symbols on

    your suit you seem "suited" to not be bothered by that...
    haha... I''m sorry.'
