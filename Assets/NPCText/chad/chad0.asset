  text1: Hello, I'm Ruby from A2, order unit. I was sent to check out what happened
    here.
  text2: Hey, I'm the one in charge here, what do you want to know?
  text3: 'The stations should be communicating with one another once per month,

    but
    comms have been down for six months now, what happened here?'
  text4: 'There''s mutants here now, it''s too much to explain. If you really want
    to know, go ask that

    doctor. Thing is we need help and we need it now.
    We''re short on supplies and we''d all love to leave this place

    for good.
    You must have come here by ship, how many people can board?'
  text5: 'There''s room for 6 regular passengers, given this situation we might be
    able to fit in

    up to around 25 if we make some room in the storage part.
    But there''s a catch, while I was trying to land,

    one of these "mutants"
    managed to damage my ship.'
  text6: 'Hmm, I see. Some of our technicians could see to that, but we''re gonna
    need parts.

    We''re low on manpower here as most of us are gone looking
    for supplies, so you gotta find the parts yourself.

    You should start looking
    for parts in the storage area, take the elevator to go there.'
  text7: Got it, I'll be on my way.
