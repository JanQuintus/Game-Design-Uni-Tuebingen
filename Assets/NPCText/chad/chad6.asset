  text2: 'Very good, you should be able to reach the second floor in the big Storage
    room now,

    According to our technicians only a master spark plug is remaining,
    then we can leave this old piece of junk.

    Also make sure to take all of
    the supplies you can find, I take it traveling to A2 will take a while.

    There''s
    bound to be a lot in the Kitchen, Gym and Living Quarters, they''re on this level,
    just follow the hallways.

    We''ll go on ahead.'
