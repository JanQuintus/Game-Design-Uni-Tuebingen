  text1: As for the missing person, this is all I found of them. Here's another part.
  text2: 'Hmm, not the time to mourn our losses, can''t do anything about that now.

    That
    reminds me, there should be some spare parts on the second floor in the big Storage
    room.'
  text3: Oh I saw that, but I couldn't get up there.
  text4: 'I see, one of our scouts lost her Gravity Launcher in the Park during a
    mutant encounter.

    You should be able to use that to get to places. Since
    part of the transportation from manufacturing is processing

    near the Park,
    you might also find some more electronics in the maintenance room.

    Head
    to the corresponding elevator when you''re ready.'
